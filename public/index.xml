      <description>The matter of authority
Fourth Sunday - Year B
Deuteronomy 18:15-20; 1 Corinthians 7:32-35; Mark 1:21-28
 
In the Old Testament, the authority of Moses goes without question. It was he who, with the help of God, led the people out of Egypt, was entrusted with the Ten Commandments, and presided over the liturgy of the covenant between God and Israel. Moses taught with authority and the people obeyed him.</description>

      <description>Time is running out
Third Sunday - Year B
Jonah 3:1-5, 10; 1 Corinthians 7:29-31; Mark 1:14-20
 
All three readings in today&amp;rsquo;s liturgy refer to time. Nineveh has only forty left, for the Corinthians time is running out, and Jesus brings the fulfillment of time. This message about the shortness of time contains an urgent call for decision: &amp;ldquo;Repent and believe in the Gospel&amp;rdquo; (Mark 1:15).
The New Testament uses two words to describe time: chronos and kairos.</description>
